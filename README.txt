The error occurs at time 303ms. The next time should be at 463ms when A should be done with I/0, but instead A is finished at 471, causing the rest of the times to be off. Every line is in order and correct and the output file is correct as well. It is only the time error. Later on however the expected I/O completion time is the actual I/O completion time as seen with these two lines. I am stumped and tried working with a TA to track down the error but had no luck.
